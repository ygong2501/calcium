# Changes Summary\n\n## 1. Memory Management\n- Added memory monitoring with psutil\n- Implemented garbage collection based on memory threshold\n- Replaced matplotlib with PIL/OpenCV for image generation\n- Added object cleanup after each simulation\n- Added batch processing for time steps\n\n## 2. Separated Dataset Creation\n- Added a dedicated dataset tab in the GUI\n- Implemented DatasetPanel class for dataset management\n- Added configurable train/val/test split ratios\n- Removed dataset creation from batch generation (now optional)\n\n## 3. Sequential Folder Naming\n- Added get_next_batch_index to scan for existing batch folders\n- Implemented numbered batch directories (batch_0, batch_1, etc.)\n\n## 4. Defect Settings Application\n- Modified _run_batch_generation to use current defect settings\n- Ensured defect configs are passed to generate_simulation_batch\n\n## 5. Edge Blur with Convolution\n- Added convolution-based edge blur (mean and motion blur)\n- Added blur options to the GUI\n- Implemented edge detection and blur application in image generation\n\nAll changes follow the minimal edit principle, maintaining compatibility with existing code while adding the requested functionality.
